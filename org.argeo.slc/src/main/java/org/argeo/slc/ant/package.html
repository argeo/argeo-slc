Bases classes for SLC Ant extensions.
<h2>Introduction</h2>
SLC Ant allows to integrate Ant and Spring in order to run an
application based on top of SLC. Sequence of actions are defined in Ant
files with specific Ant tasks referencing Spring beans implementing the
SLC interfaces. The properties of these beans can be overridden at
runtime in the Ant scripts.
<br />
SLC Ant also provides a tree-based implementation of the SLC structure
which allows to uniquely identify and reference the various actions.

<h2>Installation</h2>
The structure will be first defined by the directory tree where the Ant
files are stored. In order to define the root of this tree, you need to
place in the root directory an
<b>SLC Ant root file</b>
(default name: slcRoot.properties).
<br />
In this root file you can define a configuration directory and a work
directory (default values are provided if they are not explicitly set).
<br />
Additional properties can then be defined in files stored under the
configuration directory.
<br />
For details about the configuration and the various properties, please
refer to {@link org.argeo.slc.ant.SlcAntConfig}.

<h2>Running SLC Ant</h2>
SLC Ant can be run either via pure Ant scripts or programmatically using
{@link org.argeo.slc.ant.AntRegistryUtil}. In both cases, make sure that
SLC and its dependencies are in the classpath (Spring (always), logging
system such as log4j, Hibernate, etc.).

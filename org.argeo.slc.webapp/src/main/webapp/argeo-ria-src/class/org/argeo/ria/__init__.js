/**
 * Generic package for the Argeo Rich Internet Application based on qooxdoo (www.qooxdoo.org).
 * This is an empty application in itself, since it requires at least a basic implementation to be useful.
 * 
 * 
 * The skeleton of an ArgeoRIA is the following : 
 * 
 * + GUI Application containing a menubar, a toolbar, and an empty space for custom Perspective.
 * 
 * + Various managers : org.argeo.ria.components.ViewsManager for manipulating IView (VIEW), org.argeo.ria.event.CommandsManager 
 * for automatically wiring commands inside the application (CONTROLLER), and org.argeo.ria.remote.RequestManager for accessing the data (MODEL).
 * 
 * + A simple configuration will allow to start your own Perspective inside the application.

Argeo SLC provides components (mostly Java but also native, or GNU/Linux specific scripts and systemd units) around the life cycle of IT systems, especially those built on Argeo Commons.

## Build
Prerequisites to build this layer:
- build Argeo TP
- build Argeo Commons
- build Argeo JCR
(cf. http://git.argeo.org)

Then, run:

git clone http://git.argeo.org/gpl/argeo-slc.git --recursive
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64/
./argeo-slc/configure

cd argeo-slc
make clean all

In order to use it within an Eclipse PDE environment:

make clean all manifests

which will copy the generated OSGi MANIFESTs back to the source tree. The *.target files in argeo-tp/sdk can then be used to configure the target platforms.

In order to develop with the Eclipse RCP components (Eclipse RAP being the default), additionally run:

make -f Makefile-rcp.mk manifests
